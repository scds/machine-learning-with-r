# Machine Learning with R: K-Means Clustering

Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning approach for finding subgroups of observations within a data set. This workshop will introduce participants to the theoretical part of the most common clustering method, k-means clustering. Afterwards, participants will gain hands-on experience in how to conduct K-means clustering in R, as well as how to interpret and visualize their results.
