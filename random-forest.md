# Machine Learning with R: Random Forest Classification Approach

Random Forest is an ensemble machine learning technique used for both classification and regression tasks. It is based on the concept of decision trees, where multiple decision trees are trained on different subsets of the data, and their predictions are combined to produce a more accurate and robust final prediction. This workshop will go over the theory of Random Forests and then provide attendees with hands-on training on conducting Random Forest classification, training the data, testing accuracy, and working with tuning parameters.
